# Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze whether a customer will accept a driving-related coupon based on various contextual features such as time, location, weather, companion, and destination. The dataset was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk and is part of the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The goal is to identify the differences between customers who accepted the coupon and those who did not, and to make data-driven recommendations on when and where coupons are most effective.

## 🧪 Problem Statement
Can we predict if a customer will accept a coupon offer while driving? What factors influence this decision the most — is it the time of day, the presence of passengers, the type of coupon, or something else?
